\section{Quick Commands}

This section explains the ``quick'' commands of \pgfname. These
commands are executed more quickly than the normal commands of
\pgfname, but offer less functionality. You should use these commands
only if you either have a very large amount of commands that need to
be processed or if you expect your commands to be executed very often.



\subsection{Quick Path Construction Commands}

The difference between the quick and the normal path commands is that
the quick path commands
\begin{itemize}
\item
  do not keep track of the bounding boxes,
\item
  do not allow you to arc corners,
\item
  do not apply coordinate transformations.
\end{itemize}

However, the do use the soft-path subsystem (see
Section~\ref{section-soft-paths} for details), which allows you to mix
quick and normal path commands arbitrarily.

All quick path construction commands start with |\pgfpathq|.

\begin{command}{\pgfpathqmoveto\marg{x dimension}\marg{y dimension}}
  Either starts a path or starts a new part of a path at the coordinate
  $(\meta{x dimension},\meta{y dimension})$. The coordinate is
  \emph{not} transformed by the current coordinate transformation
  matrix. However, any lowlevel transformations apply.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgftransformxshift{1cm}
  \pgfpathqmoveto{0pt}{0pt} % no effect
  \pgfpathqlineto{1cm}{1cm} % no effect
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfpoint{2cm}{0cm}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathqlineto\marg{x dimension}\marg{y dimension}}
  The quick version of the line-to operation.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathqcurveto\marg{$s^1_x$}\marg{$s^1_y$}\marg{$s^2_x$}\marg{$s^2_y$}\marg{$t_x$}\marg{$t_y$}}
  The quick version of the curve-to operation. The first support point
  is $(s^1_x,s^1_y)$, the second support point is  $(s^2_x,s^2_y)$,
  and the target is $(t_x,t_y)$.
 
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,2);
  \pgfpathqmoveto{0pt}{0pt}
  \pgfpathqcurveto{1cm}{1cm}{2cm}{1cm}{3cm}{0cm}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfpathqcircle\marg{radius}}
  Adds a raduis around the origin of the given \meta{raduis}. This
  command is orders of magnitude faster than
  |\pgfcircle{\pgfpointorigin}{|meta{radius}|}|. 
 
\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (1,1);
  \pgfpathqcircle{10pt}
  \pgfsetfillcolor{yellow}
  \pgfusepath{stroke,fill}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{command}



\subsection{Quick Path Usage Commands}

The quick path usage commands perform similar tasks as |\pgfusepath|,
but the they
\begin{itemize}
\item
  do not add arrows,
\item
  do not modify the path in any way, in particular,
\item
  ends are not shortened,
\item
  corners are nto replaced by arcs.
\end{itemize}

Note that you \emph{have to} use the quick versions in the code of
arrow definitions since, inside these definition, you obviously do not
want arrows to be drawn.

\begin{command}{\pgfusepathqstroke}
  Strokes the path without further ado. No arrows are drawn, no
  corners are arced.

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{pgfpicture}
  \pgfpathqcircle{5pt}
  \pgfusepathqstroke
\end{pgfpicture}
\end{codeexample}
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfusepathqfill}
  Fills the path without further ado.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfusepathqfillstroke}
  Fills and then strokes the path without further ado.
\end{command}

\begin{command}{\pgfusepathqclip}
  Clips all subsequent drawings against the current path. The path is
  not processed.
\end{command}


\subsection{Quick Text Box Commands}

\begin{command}{\pgfqbox\marg{box}}
  This command inserts a \TeX\ box into a |{pgfpicture}| by
  ``escaping'' to \TeX, inserting the \meta{box} at the origin, and
  then returning to the typesetting the picture.

  The \meta{box} \emph{must} have a height, width, and depth of zero
  points. Otherwise, the output may become corrupted.
\end{command}
