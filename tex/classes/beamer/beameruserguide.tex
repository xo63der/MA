    \begin{enumerate}
    \item<1-| alert@1> Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
    \item<2-> Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers.
    \item<3-> Then $q+1$ is not divisible by any of them.
    \item<1-> Thus $q+1$ is also prime and greater than $p$.\qedhere

\part{Getting Started}

This part helps you getting started. It starts with an explanation of
how to install the class. Hopefully, this will be very simple, with a
bit of luck the whole class is already correctly installed! You will
also find an explanation of special things you should consider when
using certain other packages.

Next, a short tutorial is given that explains most of the features
that you'll need in a typical presentation. Following the tutorial you
will find a ``possible workflow'' for creating a
presentation. Following this workflow may help you avoid problems
later on.

This part includes a guidelines sections. Following these guidelines
can help you create good presentations (no guarantees, though). This
guideline section is kept as general as possible; most what is said in
that section applies to presentations in general, independently of
whether they have been created using \beamer\ or not.

At the end of this part you will find a summary of the solutions
templates that come with \beamer. You can use solutions templates to
kick-start the creation of your presentation.

\part{Building a Presentation}

This part contains an explanation of all the commands that are used to
create presentations. It starts with a section treating the commands
and environments used to create \emph{frames}, the basic building
blocks of presentations. Next, the creation of overlays is
explained.

The following three sections concern commands and methods
of \emph{structuring} a presentation. In order, the \emph{static
  global} structure, the \emph{interactive global} structure, and the
\emph{local} structure are treated.

Two further sections treat graphics and animations. Much of the
material in these sections applies to other packages as well, not just
to \beamer.

\include{beamerug-overlays}
\include{beamerug-globalstructure}
\include{beamerug-interaction}
\include{beamerug-localstructure}
\include{beamerug-graphics}
\include{beamerug-animations}




\part{Changing the Way Things Look}

\beamer\ offers ways to change the appearance of an appearance at all
levels of detail. On the top level, \emph{themes} can be used to
globally change the appearance conveniently. On the bottom level,
\emph{templates} allow you to specify the appearance of every minute
detail individually.

Two important aspects of the ``appearance'' of a presentation are
treated in extra sections: colors and fonts. Here, too, color and
font themes can be used to globally change the colors or fonts used in
a presentation, while you can still change the color or font of, say,
block titles independently of everything else.

\part{Creating Supporting Material}

The objective of the \beamer\ class is to simplify the creation of
presentations using a projector. However, a presentation rarely exists
in isolation. Material that accompanies a presentation includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Presentations should normally be accompanied by 
  \emph{handouts}, written text that the audience can read during
  and/or after your presentation is given.
\item
  You might wish to create notes for yourself that, ideally, are shown
  to you on your computer screen while the audience sees the
  presentation. 
\item
  You might wish to create a printout of your talk, either for
  yourself for checking for errors.
\item
  You might wish to create a transparancies version of your talk as a
  fall-back.
\end{itemize}

This part dicusses how \beamer\ helps you with the creation of the
above.

\part{Howtos}

This part contains explanations-of-how-to-do-things (commonly known as
\emph{howtos}). These explanations are not really part of the
``\beamer\ core.'' Rather, they explain how to use \beamer\ to achieve
a certain effect or how get something special done.

The first howto is about tricky uncovering situations.

The second howto explains how you can import (parts or) presentations
created using some other \LaTeX-presentation class, like \prosper.
